# Python Random Number Generation Utilities

I have a fascination with [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon)'s and other great thinkers like him's works on information theory. I also have some *(possibly)* nifty ideas about personal information security. So I've decided to combine all of my works in personal cryptogoraphy and entropy into this one repository of scripts, apps, configurations, console utilites, embedded systems, and analysis notebooks on the subject here. Feel free to use and **constructively peer review** my findings. I'm a self taught software engineer and a university taught electrical engineer, so although I have a decent academic experience and intregue in this field, I would love feedback on anything I find here.
